## The Shift in Enterprise Priorities

The digital economy is entering a new phase. As AI systems become embedded in critical business processes, the question is no longer whether organizations need safety protocols—but how quickly they can implement them.

VASO represents our thesis on this transition: that evidence management and compliance verification will become as fundamental to enterprise operations as cloud infrastructure became in the 2010s.

## First Principles Analysis

When we evaluate emerging markets, we start with a simple question: What will every serious organization need in five years that few have today?

For digital safety, the answer is clear:

- Immutable evidence trails
- Automated compliance verification
- Real-time audit capabilities
- Cross-jurisdictional regulatory mapping

These aren't optional features. They're infrastructure requirements.

## Market Positioning

The regulatory landscape is fragmenting. The EU AI Act, emerging US state-level requirements, and Asian market regulations are creating a compliance maze that most organizations are unprepared to navigate.

VASO is built to solve this problem at the infrastructure level. Rather than offering point solutions, we're creating the foundational layer that enables organizations to demonstrate accountability across regulatory regimes.

## Our Conviction

We invest in what we believe will define the digital economy's next chapter. Digital safety isn't a trend—it's a structural requirement.

The organizations that build safety into their operational DNA today will have significant advantages in the regulatory environment of 2030 and beyond. VASO is our vehicle for participating in that transformation.
