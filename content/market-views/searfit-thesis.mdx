## The Digital Real Estate Opportunity

In the physical world, location determines value. In the digital economy, traffic determines value.

Searfit, led by Lead Author Jinray, represents our investment in digital real estate—a platform that aggregates attention and converts it into sustainable traffic assets.

## First Principles: What Creates Digital Value?

When evaluating digital media investments, we focus on:

- Organic traffic acquisition capability
- Content moat and audience loyalty
- Monetization efficiency
- Platform independence

Searfit scores well across these dimensions, building what we consider "owned traffic" rather than rented audience.

## The Lifestyle Curation Model

Unlike algorithmically-driven content farms, Searfit builds value through curated, high-quality lifestyle content. This approach creates:

- Higher engagement rates
- Stronger audience trust
- Premium monetization opportunities
- Defensible competitive position

## Portfolio Synergies

Searfit and VASO represent complementary investments. One builds attention assets; the other builds trust infrastructure. Together, they position Zavistone across the value chain of the digital economy.

## Long-term View

Traffic assets appreciate over time when built on quality fundamentals. We're invested in Searfit's multi-year trajectory, not short-term metrics. The goal is to build an enduring digital property.
