## The Current Moment

We are witnessing the most significant technological transition since the internet. AI is not merely a new tool—it's a new substrate for economic activity.

At Zavistone, our approach remains grounded in First Principles: we seek to understand not just what is happening, but why it matters and what comes next.

## The Infrastructure Layer

Every major technological transition creates opportunities at the infrastructure layer. The internet created opportunities in connectivity, cloud, and security. AI will create analogous opportunities in:

- Data management and provenance
- Safety and compliance verification
- Human-AI interaction frameworks
- Automated decision auditing

These are the building blocks that every AI-enabled organization will require.

## Our Thesis

The organizations winning today are building large language models and generative AI applications. The organizations winning in 2030 will be building the infrastructure that makes those applications trustworthy, auditable, and compliant.

This is where we're positioning our portfolio.

## Looking Forward

The AI transition will unfold over decades, not years. We're building for that timeline—investing in infrastructure that becomes more valuable as AI adoption accelerates.

Our conviction: the organizations that control the trust layer of the AI economy will capture significant value. VASO and our strategic initiatives are designed to position Zavistone in that emerging market.
